# Explaination
We were working on another sound idea (called "SuperSonic") until realizing the original STT cannot be fetch from Magenta also classification demo will be greatly limited. We decide to move to this new idea at last 10 hours for we find the business potential in this new "Einkaufen" idea could be huge. But it also leads to that the implementation of "Einkaufen" idea is greatly missed.

if you are interested in the SuperSonic idea [https://remote-rhapsody-platform.hubraum.com/#/projects/5fbfa744ac10a7001b65dc1a](https://remote-rhapsody-platform.hubraum.com/#/projects/5fbfa744ac10a7001b65dc1a) you can see our progress on the old idea here [https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/SoundClassificationDemo](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/SoundClassificationDemo)
